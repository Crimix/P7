}{% the abstract

Whenever people make use of search engines like Google, or social media like
Facebook or Twitter, they are likely to find themselves in a filter bubble: a
system of positive reinforcement where they only engage with like minded people,
or are shown products or news which create a positive reaction. This can
cause problems around topics such as politics, because people might be unaware
of the existence of different argument or opinions. As such, This project has
developed a web-application which can determine a user's filter bubble on the
social media site Twitter. This is done using a combination of a Naive Bayes
Network, and a sentiment analyzer based around political keywords and the sharing of
news media. The developed system consists of a database to store analyzed data,
a server back-end to gather information and classify users, and a
web-application front-end. 
% In the end, the Bag-of-Words model has an accuracy of
% above 90\% while the Naive Bayes Network has an accuracy of just below 50\%.
% While the Bag-of-Words model is currently more accurate, it is based on a static
% image of the current political climate. As such, the Naive Bayes Model should
% become better over time, as more data can be gathered and used to refine and
% train the model.
