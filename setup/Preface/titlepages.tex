}{% the abstract

When people make use of search engines like Google, or social media like
Facebook or Twitter, they are likely to find themselves in a filter bubble: a
system of positive reinforcement where they only engage with like-minded people
or are shown products or news which create a positive reaction. Hiding
information like this can cause problems around topics, such as politics,
because people might be unaware of the existence of different arguments or
opinions. In order to solve this problem, this project has been used to develop
a web application which can determine a user's filter bubble on Twitter. This is
done using a combination of a Naive Bayes Classifier, and a sentiment analyser
based on political keywords and the sharing of news media. The developed system
consists of a database to store analysed data, a server back-end to gather
information and classify users and a web-application front-end.
In the end, the Bag-of-Words model has an accuracy of 96\% while the Naive
Bayes Classifier failed to accurately classify users.
While the Bag-of-Words model is currently more accurate, it is based on a static
image of the current political climate, the Naive Bayes Model should
become better over time, as more data can be gathered and used to refine and
train the model.
