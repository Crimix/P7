}{% the abstract

Whenever people make use of search engines like Google, or social media like
Facebook or Twitter, they are likely to find themselves in a filter bubble: a
system of positive reinforcement where they only engage with likeminded people,
or are shown products or news which create a positive reachtion. This can
cause problems around topics such as politics, because people might be unaware
of the existance of different argument or opinions. As such, This project has
develped a web-application which can determine a user's filter bubble on the
social media site. This is done using a combination of a Naive Bayes Network,
and a sentiment analyzer based around political keywords, and the sharing of
news media. The developed system consists of a database to store analyzed data,
a server back-end to gather information and classify users, and a
web-application front-end.
