A problem with the Bag-of-Words approach to determining the user's political
leaning is that the model is unable to adjust itself or to react to a shifting
political landscape. This is problematic, as some indicators of political
affiliation, like names of current politicians, will likely change over time. In
order to alleviate this problem, we have begun implementation of a system that
will be able to identify patterns in keywords used by users.\\ 
The general idea is that whenever the algorithm determines a clear political
affiliation for a user, we can analyze that user to find more keywords which we
can add to our keywords list. This would be done by finding uncommon words in
the user's tweets' text. These words would then be added to a list of currently
monitored words, and whenever a person with a clear political affiliation uses
these words, we increment a counter for either left-wing or right-wing use of
that word. Whenever we determine that we have enough data, we can add this word
to our list of political keywords.\nl

While this approach is not perfect, it would allow us to dynamically update our
model with a shifting political climate.
