\chapter{Weekly Progress}
\fix{}{Now, I think it would be good to have reflections for each part. For example now you plan to do a code-freeze - then would be a good spot to look back on your 
last weeks and reflect on your project working style - e.g., what would you do differently the next time etc - what would you do the same?
Maybe you can do 3-4 big reflections in total, with the last one  looking back over the whole project (that one a bit longer than the other ones)}
In this chapter our weekly progress and thoughts are described\ldots
