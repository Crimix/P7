\chapter{Reflection}\label{cha:weeklyProg}
In this chapter we provide an overall reflection of the project. We have
structured the reflection in 4 parts. In \autoref{sec:FirRef}, which is up to
and including week 42, we reflect on what we consider the first part of the
project. This is the early part of the project, we have an idea of what to do
with the project but have not finalised it. We consider this part to have ended
after a meeting with Dr. Stefan Schmid, which helped us get a much better idea
of what we wanted to do with the project. In \autoref{sec:SecRef}, which is up
to and including week 48, we reflect on what we consider the second part of the
project. In this part we tried to do a lot of things, some succeeded, while
others were abandonded due to the new ambitions of the project. In
\autoref{sec:FinRef} we reflect back on the project as a whole. Finally in
\autoref{sec:PainAndSuffering} we discuss and reflect upon what happened week
by week in the semester.
