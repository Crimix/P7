\chapter{Reflection}\label{cha:weeklyProg}
In this chapter, we provide an overall reflection on the project. We have
structured the reflection into four parts. In \autoref{sec:FirRef}, which is up
to and including week 42, we reflect on what we consider the first part of the
project. At this point, we have an idea of what to do with the project but have
not settled on any concrete idea. We consider this part to have ended after a
meeting with Stefan Schmid, who helped us get a much better idea of what we
wanted to do with the project. In \autoref{sec:SecRef}, which is up to and
including week 48, we reflect on what we consider the second part of the
project. In this part, we tried to do a lot of things; some succeeded, while
others were abandoned due to the new ambitions of the project. In
\autoref{sec:FinRef}, we reflect back on the project as a whole. Finally, in
\autoref{sec:PainAndSuffering}, we discuss and reflect upon what happened week
by week in the semester.
