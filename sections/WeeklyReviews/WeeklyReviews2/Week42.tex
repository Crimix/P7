\subsection{Week 42}
\subsubsection{What Happened This Week} 
During this week we have worked on restructuring and improving upon existing
parts of the project. We continued brainstorming on how to use the data we
gather and prepared a presentation for our supervisor and Dr. Stefan Schmid.

\subsubsection{Reflection}
We should have had a better idea of how to use the data we gathered earlier in
the project, as our primary focus until now has been on how to gather the data.
We are also still considering if our solution meets the requirement of being an
``internet- application, agent, or service'' and what is expected, which should
have been clear by now and will be dealt with at next supervisor meeting.
Creating a presentation was great for reflecting upon our work as a group, and
pushed us to polish some of the ideas before we show them.

\subsubsection{Next Week}
Next week we will start with the presentation on Monday, and we will plan the
weeks task after we recieve feedback.


% Our Progress:
% Report: We have restructured the research chapter of the report, and updated
% the problem formulation and it is ready for you to read. We have also
% formulated a list of requirements for our solution which we would like
% feedback on as well.
%  Code: Nothing noteworthy since the last update.
%  The agenda for the meeting:
% 1. Presentation 
% 2. Feedback
% 3. Which approach would you recommend to analyse for the filter bubble data?
% So far, our data consists of friends, followers, tweets (words, hashtags,
% links, news media). We are unsure of how to best analyze this data.
% 4. Should we find live user test the solution with (would most likely be an
% American using Twitter)? 5. A requirement for the project is for our
% application to be internet-application, - agent, or -service. Since we use an
% API for all our Internet-related operations, would you consider this
% requirement as being met?
