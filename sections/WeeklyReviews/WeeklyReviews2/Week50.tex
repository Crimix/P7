\subsection{Week 50}
\subsubsection{What Happened this Week?}
During this week, we worked hard on finishing the report for Friday. Many new
sections and major reconstructions have been performed on the report. The plan
is for everyone to read and comment on the report over the weekend and finish
it next week. We also had our usability test during another social night which
made it easier for the test user to come by.

\subsubsection{Reflection}
We are quite happy with the progress this week. When it comes to editing
the reflection chapter, much could have been done differently. The
usability evaluation was rushed quite a bit. We had not entirely tested it on
ourselves and the computer running the system did not have some of the elements
for the task.
However, there were many situations where we could see she had issues. The
results of the test were still great and many improvements happened as a result
of it. The raw and premature test was probably not the best experience from the
user's point of view.
By doing, this the biggest flaws and mistakes can be removed and
make a better experience for the user.

\subsubsection{Next Week}
During the next week, we plan to go through the notes on the report that the
group members created over the weekend and apply fixes. Since the report would not get
anything new and the code is frozen, there is no need for a weekly review.
