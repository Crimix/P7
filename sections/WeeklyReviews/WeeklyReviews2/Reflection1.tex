\section{Reflections on the First Half}\label{sec:FirRef}
After the meeting with Stefan Schmid many changes happened; the scope of the
project was expanded and a rough architecture determined. We also decided
on which models to use in analysing Twitter users.\nl

In hindsight, we should have decided on the scope and architecture earlier. This
would have meant that we could have begun working on the different parts
earlier. Additionally, we should have spent less time writing the analysis, as a
lot of changes, removals and additions have happened since the earlier drafts
and versions.\nl

It also took too long to finalise a specific topic, breaking the
filter bubble, and deciding to proceed with analysing political biases.\nl

This has resulted in lots of changes happening in a very short time frame,
which has left us working on a lot of different parts. Though we consider the
ideas and increased level of ambition worth it.
