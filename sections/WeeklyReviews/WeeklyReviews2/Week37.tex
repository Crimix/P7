\subsection{Week 37}
\subsubsection{What Happened This Week}
We started the project by researching the ``\fb'' and looked at different
articles related to it. We also researched different social media sites and
looked at what information could be gathered. In the Web Intelligence
course, we were introduced to web crawlers which seem promising.\nl

We set up GIT repositories for code and report and decided which members
are responsible for what. We decided to write our report in Latex, using
Eclipse as an editor and GIT for version control, as several members have
positive experiences with this.

\subsubsection{Reflection}
We have found that social media sites are a suitable choice to gather user
information, and we reckon it can be used to identify the \fb. Although we have
decided to use Eclipse there is still a lot of push for using ShareLatex.
We have spent a lot of time discussing work preferences and hope that it has
created a better understanding of how each of us expects to work.

\subsubsection{Next Week}
For next week we want to finish reading the articles our supervisor has sent us.
We also want to have a draft of the analysis and an initiating problem ready for our
supervisor.
