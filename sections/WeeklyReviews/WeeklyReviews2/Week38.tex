\subsection{Week 38} 
\subsubsection{What Happened This Week} 
Using the articles from last week we have thought of a few more ideas, mainly
using emotional words. We continued doing research on social media sites, APIs
and web crawlers. In particular, we have begun to look at other social media
than Facebook, as it seems very restrictive.\nl

We are going to use some elements from SCRUM, mainly using a SCRUM board and
having daily morning meetings. We have decided to try with both a physical
version, see \autoref{Board}, and a digital version using Trello. This is
because different members have had a positive experience with both, as such we
want to try both for about a week and see what works best.

\subsubsection{Reflection}
The main problem currently is our busy schedule which leaves us with little time
to work on the project. While the report has been receiving additions they are
quite rough, and our plan is to use them as a skeleton. This could become a
problem if we continue to build on it without refining it.\nl

We have begun using some of the SCRUM ideas, but have so far not been doing the
sprints. This is mainly because we have felt that it would be difficult to do
something at this stage, at it the tasks sizes are hard to know.

\subsubsection{Next Week}
Next week we want to begin refining the social media analysis into a finished
version. We plan to look into how to actually gather the user data.






% Facebook is restrictive, besides that we need to ask for permission. So far we
% are thinking of going in a different direction from facebook. We are looking
% into what is available with twitter and reddit. Alot seems to be available at
% twitter.
% 
% Klaus has had a dat 6 group. We have a degree so we can reach out to companies,
% and we seem more professional. We need a to reflect, and evaluate our UI. We can
% look into books and look for what design process we can follow to develop a UI.
% When we test it should not be a mock-up, but if nothing else provide the
% illusion of depth.
% 
% For reflection, we consider adding a chapter for describing the process.
% 
% We edited the filter bubble and Facebook research parts of the report and
% continued work on the webcrawler.
% Finished research on the links from Klaus, and structured an idea for the final
% webagent.
% Begun on the fundamental request builder to fetch information from Twitter.
% 
% 
% Mail Our Progress:
% We have found that Facebook does not seem to be that great for accurate data.
% We have researched on basic crawlers and its seems like we need permission to
% crawl.
% Twitter and Reddit seem like the best options from our current research.
% 
% The agenda for the meeting:
% 1. Web crawlers and limited access to major social hubs, Facebook doesn't want
% people to crawl their sites. While it seems to be limited on Twitter.
% 2. What do you expect from a 7th semester project? Aside from the semester
% description? 3. How should we document our process? Lone said we needed to
% describe this.
% 
% 
% 
% 
% Here are our notes from today's meeting 
% 
% ---------- Current idea
% for the structure of the rapport:
% Intro (problem description)
% 
% Research Social medial Data gathering Web agent?
% 
% Problem Formulation
% 
% GUI design
% 
% Implementation (done by 25. nov)
% 
% Test User tests Evaluation of the UI Other tests?
% 
% Evaluation
% 
% Rapport:
% Introduction seems good.
% Chapter 2 - Should be more distinctly separated, between formal and reflection.
% Be more concrete about everything, less would, shouldâ€¦
% 
% Discussion:
% Twitter has good possibilities, as we can access a lot of data through their
% API, though we can only make a limited amount of calls every 15 min.
% 
% Thoughts on UI:
% What should the user be shown? Can we find enough info to break the bubble We
% will need to briefly describe the process of designing a GUI but we do not need
% to describe the whole process of iterating through the designs.
% 
% Reflections:
% For the process we can describe some of the difficulties of having all the
% different combination of study. As we need to be better to manage our time. We
% should add our experiences with researching facebook, twitter and reddit and why
% we chose what we chose.
