\subsection{Week 41}\label{week41}
\subsubsection{What Happened This Week}
This week, we have agreed to a meeting with Stefan Schmid on the 23rd of
October. He has experience in this field and has agreed to attend a short
presentation where he will share his thoughts and ideas. We have, therefore,
begun to brainstorm the \ac{GUI} for the application and made some
considerations as to what will be shown to the user, see
\autoref{initguisketch2}.\nl

\figx[0.15]{initguisketch2}{A sketch of our initial idea for the \ac{GUI}.}

The idea is to show the user their statistics, such as followers, accounts they
follow, their political bias, the accounts they follow's political bias and a
then provide a list of alternative news sources that are outside their bubble.

\subsubsection{Reflection} 
During the development of the \ac{GUI}, we found that we had not given much
thought to what we wanted to present to the user. While designing the \ac{GUI},
we came up with other cool features, we could extrapolate from the gathered
data. Though we do not think that we are going to do everything which we have
shown in \autoref{initguisketch2}, it should be useful to help visualise our idea when
we have the meeting. 

\subsubsection{Next Week}
Next week, we will finish the restructuring of the report and continue
development of the program. Again, we do not have much time for the project as
we have a mini project due for Tuesday.
