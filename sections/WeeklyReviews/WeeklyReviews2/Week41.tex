\subsection{Week 41}\label{week41}
\subsubsection{What Happened This Week}
This week we have agreed to a meeting with Dr. Stefan Schmid on the 23rd of
October. He has experience within this field and has agreed to attend a short
presentation where he will share his thoughts and ideas. We have therefore begun
to brainstorm the \ac{GUI} for the application and made some considerations as
to what will be shown to the user, see \autoref{initguisketch2}.\nl

\figx[0.15]{initguisketch2}{A sketch of our initial idea for the \ac{GUI}.}

The idea is to show the user his statistics, such as followers, people he
follows, his political bias, the people he follows political bias and a then
provide a list of alternative news sources that are outside his bubble.

\subsubsection{Reflection} 
During the development of the \ac{GUI}, we found that we had not given much
thought to what we wanted to present to the user. While designing the \ac{GUI}
we came up with other cool features we could extrapolate from the gathered
data. Though we do not think we are going to do every thing which we have shown
in \autoref{initguisketch2}, it should be useful to help visualise our idea when
we have the meeting. 

\subsubsection{Next Week}
We will finish the restructuring of the report and continue development of the
program. We again do not have much time for the project, as we have a mini
project due for tuesday.
