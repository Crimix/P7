\subsection{Week 47}
\subsubsection{What Happened This Week}
Not much has been done on the project this week because of our Programming
Paradigms delivery. However, we have managed to work on the weekly summaries
because they were not reflective enough. This have been fixed. We have also
managed to make the Bag-of-Words model eight times faster than before. Our supervisor has
helped us plan another meeting with Stefan Schmid the 29th of
November where we will do a small presentation.

\subsubsection{Reflection}
A major issue has been found when testing our Naive Bayes model. The model
currently predicts that everything belongs in the same category. This should
have been caught earlier by performing tests and looking more closely at the
predictions, and not just the accuracy.

\subsubsection{Next Week}
The goal for next week is to prepare a small presentation and begin to work
more on the report as it has currently been neglected for a while. 


% There haven’t been one much on the project this week because of our Programming
% and Paradigms delivery, however, the following have been done.
% Work have been done on weekly summaries, they weren’t reflective enough which
% have been fixed.
% Our supervisor have also helped us getting a meeting with an expert on the
% field, who will listen to what we plan on doing and give us feedback.
% The analysis algorithms have been improved is is now 8 times faster.

% 
% A major issue has been found when testing the Naive Bayes model. The model
% currently predicts that everything belongs in the same category. We have tried
% to make sure that there is an equal number of cases for each of the outputs,
% though that only changed the prediction to another category.
% 
% We have optimized the analysis algorithm, and improved its runtime by a factor
% of 8. We have also setup the worker such that it can be activated by a call to
% its API. We have also made it possible to post the result to the database
% server.
