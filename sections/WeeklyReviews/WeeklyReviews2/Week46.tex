\subsection{Week 46} 
\subsubsection{What Happened This Week} 
Work has progressed smoothly for the Bag-Of-Words model, we have tried to
gather a large of words from classified Twitter users. The goal is to determine
which words they are likely to use so we can give the keywords a political
score. We have managed to get the Queue Server and the Worker to work together
and queue requests for tweets. We have also classified 120 tweets by hand and
labeled them according to the 5 classes: right, slightly right, neutral,
slightly left and left. The results after training a Naive Bayes model on 90 of
those tweets were bad, with an accuracy of 26\% on 5 classes and 44\% on 3.

\subsubsection{Reflection} 
In hindsight, we should have written better summaries for each of the prior
weeks, as we have been pushing these weekly reflections further and further
back. Because of this, we have had more attention to actually writing decent notes
at the end of the week.

\subsubsection{Next Week} 
Next week will be slow because of a mini project in Programming Paradigms.
Besides that, everyone has something to work on which will likely not be
finished doing the week.



% We would like feedback on the two weekly summaries, we would like to know if
% the format is fitting.
%   Status:
% We have added a feature to the program which retrieves tweets from a set of
% pre-classified (left/right) users, and determine what words they are more
% likely to use. The idea behind this is, that if we can identify what words are
% most likely to be used by users of specific political alignments, we can
% dynamically update our list of keywords, which we already use for classifying
% users. This, however, requires a large amount of users with pre-known
% alignments. To begin, we have manually compiled a list of twitter users, which
% we use to get started with the word gathering. The idea is, that whenever we
% classify a user with a high degree of certainty, we can add that user to our
% list of users from which we identify words. We have also begun commenting the
% code.
%  The queue server api now interacts with the queue server instance and are
% able to queue jobs for execution. The queue server instance uses the worker
% for each job. The worker has been adapted for use by different threads, such
% that the limits are not the same for each thread.
% Then work began on the section for the queue server api.
%  Did more research into dense feature vectors and other solutions. Found an
% algorithm called word2vec that is interesting.
% With 120 tweets which we have classified by hand, into 5 classes: Right,
% little right, neutral, little left, left. With these tweets we trained a Naive
% Bayesian with bad results, with 5 classes it had a 26% success rate, with 3
% classes it had 44% success. Used a simple SVM with a 3 classes, it had a
% success rate of 30%.
%  Added a TextProcessing Library to the project, which allows us to process
% tweets.
%   As for the agenda:
% We would like feedback on the weekly summaries from the report
