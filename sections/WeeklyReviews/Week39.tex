\section*{Week 39}
\subsection*{What Happend This Week}
We created an idea for the structure of the report, and what we wanted in the
chapters. We also set the date 25. November, as the day we would like
to be done with programming. The introduction part is finished, the other
analysis chapter need to more coherent. We have also found that thte Twitter API
gives us access to a vast amount of userdata, althouth they limit the amount of
calls we can make every 15 minutes. We have also made some thoughts on the UI of
our application, and if we can get enough informaion to break the filter
bubble.

\subsection*{Evaluation}
It was a setback to find how difficult it was to get access to social medea
sites's userdata through a web crawler. We are now investigating if there is a
way to still use it. However, Twitter seems like a good choice, there were
also sources explaining that tweets can be used to break the bubble.
Workflow is still a little slower than we liked, and there are not as much being
finished as expected.

\subsection*{Next Week}
We are going to try setting a new rule with people meeting everyday at 9:00 if
theres no lectures, since it is only monday which is completely free of
lectures. We hope that this will enabel us to get some more work done.
Next week we want to finish the analysis part of the report, and be able to pull
some data from Twitter.
