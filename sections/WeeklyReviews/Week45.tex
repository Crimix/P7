% The primary aspects of the GUI has been completed. It can initiate a new request, asking the user for permission to use their account for requests, as well as asking for the Twitter account they wish to check and the email-address they would like to receive notifications on when the work has been completed. The requests are added to a queue for asynchronous transmission of details to the QueueServer.
% 
% The API for the QueueServer has been created in C# such that it is possible to create jobs given just a twitter name and API key. In the report the implementation section now contains documentation about the Database API and the new API, the new API is not that well documented yet.
% It is now possible to add requests to the queue in the form of tasks, which are executed in parallel.

% This week we have continued using libraries to create a neural network several issues have appeared as the we tried the network on a data sample of reviews.
% Currently we are using a sparse feature vector, each feature is represented by a position in a array, this means that as the dictionary grows, so too does the feature vector. This represents a problem as on a sample of 5000 reviews provides more than 20000 features. With the current library we are using we quickly run out of memory as the features grow, limit seems to be around 150 features.
% We have tried shifting to using Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines, which allows us to have a larger dictionary before we run out of memory.
% 
% A couple of questions regarding machine learning and models:
% Do you know who we need to ask for further information use of a server cluster?
% Do you have any experience with Dense Feature Vectors?
% Do you any possible solutions/ideas?
% 
% 
% Meeting:
% Spent some time getting Klaus op to speed.
% 
% Using a web gui, which communicates with a queue server, which forwards work to a worker.
% The worker does the number crunching.
% 
% The database server uses a rest interface, it connects the workers and the queue server.
% 
% We have two different approaches:
% Use a Machine Learning model:
% Neural Network is highly limited as it runs out of memory if thereâ€™s more than 150 inputs
% Naive Bayes runs out of memory at around 70.000 different words
% Support Vector Machine is slow.
% Use an Algorithm:
% Use links, keywords and hashtags which each has a value
% Different parts have different values
% Needs to be optimized as it feels slow
% 
% Simple GUI which allows for connections with Twitter, it does not have any connections with the other parts currently.
% 
% Need to contact Stefan regarding the server.
