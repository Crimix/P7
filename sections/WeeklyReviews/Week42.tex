Our Progress:
Report: We have restructured the research chapter of the report, and updated the problem formulation and it is ready for you to read. We have also formulated a list of requirements for our solution which we would like feedback on as well. 

Code: Nothing noteworthy since the last update.

The agenda for the meeting:
1. Presentation
2. Feedback
3. Which approach would you recommend to analyse for the filter bubble data? So far, our data consists of friends, followers, tweets (words, hashtags, links, news media). We are unsure of how to best analyze this data.
4. Should we find live user test the solution with (would most likely be an American using Twitter)?
5. A requirement for the project is for our application to be internet-application, - agent, or -service. Since we use an API for all our Internet-related operations, would you consider this requirement as being met?
