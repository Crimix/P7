Hello Klaus

We would like feedback on the two weekly summaries, we would like to know if the format is fitting. 


Status:
We have added a feature to the program which retrieves tweets from a set of pre-classified (left/right) users, and determine what words they are more likely to use. The idea behind this is, that if we can identify what words are most likely to be used by users of specific political alignments, we can dynamically update our list of keywords, which we already use for classifying users. This, however, requires a large amount of users with pre-known alignments. To begin, we have manually compiled a list of twitter users, which we use to get started with the word gathering. The idea is, that whenever we classify a user with a high degree of certainty, we can add that user to our list of users from which we identify words. We have also begun commenting the code.  

The queue server api now interacts with the queue server instance and are able to queue jobs for execution. The queue server instance uses the worker for each job. The worker has been adapted for use by different threads, such that the limits are not the same for each thread. 
Then work began on the section for the queue server api. 

Did more research into dense feature vectors and other solutions. Found an algorithm called word2vec that is interesting.
With 120 tweets which we have classified by hand, into 5 classes: Right, little right, neutral, little left, left. With these tweets we trained a Naive Bayesian with bad results, with 5 classes it had a 26% success rate, with 3 classes it had 44% success. Used a simple SVM with a 3 classes, it had a success rate of 30%.

Added a TextProcessing Library to the project, which allows us to process tweets.


As for the agenda:
We would like feedback on the weekly summaries from the report
