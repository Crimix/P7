\section{Reflection Stage 1}
After the meeting with stefan a lot of changes happened, the scope of the
project was increased and set, a rough architecture determined and decided on
what models to use in analysing twitter uses.\nl

In hindsight we should have decided on the scope and architecture earlier. This
would have meant that we could have begun work on the different part earlier.
Additionally we should have spent less time on writing the analysis. A lot of
changes, removals and additions have happened since the earlier draft and
version.\nl

It also took far too long to finalize a specific topic, breaking the
filter bubble, and deciding to proceed with analysing political biases.\nl

All of this has resulted a lot changes happening in a very short time frame,
which has left us working on a lot of different parts. Though we consider the
ideas and increased level of ambition worth it.
