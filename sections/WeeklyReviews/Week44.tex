\section*{Week 44}
\subsection*{What Happend This Week}
We made an early model of a solution including some machine intelligence and
wrote about sentiment analysis. We set-up the database and the \ac{API} for the
database and the authorization for the \ac{API} for the database, and an
implementation part for it in the report Queue server and \ac{REST} \ac{API} for
queues server Setup \ac{GUI} using Laravel and started working on Twitter
authentication.

\subsection*{Evaluation}
We are happy with the direction it is going now, but the workload feels much
harder than before the meeting last week. However, we feel like we are on the
right track, and we talked with our supervisor about getting another meeting
with the expert on a later date. The machine intelligence part seems to be
difficult, and we are running into some problems. Therefore, a person will be
assigned to create an algorithm in case it does not work out as intended.

\subsection*{Next Week} 
Next week we hope to have a better feeling about how to classify the tweets and
keep up with progress being made.
