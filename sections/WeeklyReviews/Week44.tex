\section*{Week 44}
\subsection*{What Happend This Week}
We made an early model of our neural network and wrote about sentiment analysis.
We setup the database and the API for the database and the authorazation for
the API for the database, and an implementation part for it in the report 
Queue server and REST API for queues server Setup GUI using Laravel and
started working on twitter authentication.

\subsection*{Evaluation}
We are happy with the direction it is going now, but the workload feels much
harder than before the meeting last week. However, we feel like we are on the
right track, and we talked with our supervisor about getting another meeting
with the expert on a later date. The neural network seems to be difficult and we
are running into some problems, therefore we a person will be assigned to
create an algorithm incase it doesn't work out as intended.

\subsection*{Next Week}
Next week we hope have a better feeling about how to classify the tweets, and
keep up with progress being made.
