\subsection*{What Happend This Week}


\subsection*{Evaluation}


\subsection*{Next Week}



There haven’t been one much on the project this week because of our Programming and Paradigms delivery, however, the following have been done.
Work have been done on weekly summaries, they weren’t reflective enough which have been fixed. 
Our supervisor have also helped us getting a meeting with an expert on the field, who will listen to what we plan on doing and give us feedback.
The analysis algorithms have been improved is is now 8 times faster.


A major issue has been found when testing the Naive Bayes model. The model currently predicts that everything belongs in the same category. We have tried to make sure that there is an equal number of cases for each of the outputs, though that only changed the prediction to another category. 

We have optimized the analysis algorithm, and improved its runtime by a factor of 8. We have also setup the worker such that it can be activated by a call to its API. We have also made it possible to post the result to the database server.
