\chapter{Requirements Definition}\label{cha:req}
Following the problem statemet in \autoref{ch:problem}, this chapter will be
used to determine the actual requirements of the developed software solution.

% Klaus: The web aspect seems to be missing? From the study regulations: A
% suitable user interface implies that it is possible to interact with the
% developed solution using a web based interface.
% E.G., an end user application has a web based user interface. An agent or a
% service may not necessarily have a web based user interface, but would usually
% have a web based A further reuirement is that the implementation needs to have
% ascalaable acrhitecture

\section{Functional Requirements}

\begin{requirement}[req:twitter-user-retrieval]{Retrieve user and pertinent information from Twitter}
Given a Twitter username, the program should be capable of retrieving
tweets and information about a user, including the accounts they are following.
\end{requirement}

\begin{requirement}{Follow Twitter \ac{API} guideline}
The program should follow the Twitter \ac{API} guidelines such as not making
more requests than the guidelines specifies per. 15 minutes. This means that the
program should also be capable of keeping track of how many requests it has
used, how many it is allowed to use and when the limit resets.
\end{requirement}

\begin{requirement}{Identify political beliefs of a user}
The program should be able to identify and inform the user of his/her political
belief and and of that of those he/she follows. It should do this by analysing
the words, hashtags and links.

% Saved for a little while 12-12-17
% Using the links and comparing them to the list of bias news site and also taking
% into account the emotional words, the program should be able to identify and
% inform the user of his/her political beliefs. 
% The program should be able to identify hashtags and \acp{URL} in the downloaded
% tweets such that they can be used for bias analysis of the user who posted it or
% the user following the user that posted it.
% The program should be able to use the links identified in the tweets and compare
% them to a list of bias news site which should be created and stored in the
% program. 
% The program should be able to identify and use emotional words to examine a
% users view on different subjects in the tweets. 
\end{requirement}

\begin{requirement}{Web-Application Front End}
The application should make use of a front end developed as a web application.
This application should be hostable on a server such that it can be presented as
a web page.
\end{requirement}

\begin{requirement}{Server Back End}
The logic of the developed software should be hosted on a server, which receives
requests from the front end, and returns analyzed data and the determined
conclusions.
\end{requirement}

\begin{requirement}{Store Analysis Data on Database}
The program should be able to efficiently store the downloaded tweets or
similar relevant data on a database, such that the need for retrieving new data
is reduced.
\end{requirement}

\begin{requirement}{Scalable Architecture}
The server back end must be capable of handling an undefined number of
concurrent user requests, as if it acted as the back end of an actual web page. As such,
the server must queue requests, and make sure to handle them all.
\end{requirement}

\begin{requirement}{Twitter API Resource Limits}
As each individual Twitter user or application has a limited amount of available
calls to the Twitter API, the front end should make use of the official
embedded Twitter authentication implementation. This should allow the system to
use that user's pool of API calls. This should make the application scalable for
a larger potential user base.
\end{requirement}

\begin{requirement}{\ac{API} Communication}
The developed software must make use of \ac{API}s in order to communicate between
each other. These \ac{API}s must use verification such that only approved
requests are processed. These \ac{API}s should be used for the database, and the server back
end.
\end{requirement}



%Klaus: Some sort of recommendation would be nice as you want to break out of
% the fiflter bubble. (``popping'') (This is where some sort of clustering
% could come into play, though it could be optional - lets talk live))



\section{Usability Requirements}
\fix{}{some cite here would be nice - do you follow some recommendations from
the literature?}
\begin{requirement}[req:userfriendly-interface]{Userfriendly interface} 
\begin{itemize}
  \item The \ac{GUI} should be simplistic upon launch, with every element
  immediately recognizable.
  \item There should be no doubts about what information is needed and which button(s) to press.
  \item In case of any options being implemented, they should be self-explanatory when possible.
  \item When this is not possible, there should be a helpful description
  accompanying the option.
  \item If descriptive texts are necessary, they should be easily accessible and
  it should be obvious how to reach them.
  \item Before the user submits their information, there should be no doubts
  about what the information is used for, how it is used, who will have access to it and what type of data they will get in return.
  \item The returned data should be processed and presented in a simple manner that is immediately understood by the
        target user.
\end{itemize}
\end{requirement}
