\subsection{Reddit Analysis}\label{sec:reddit-analysis}
Reddit is a social news aggregation and discussion website with over 250
million users \citep{AdvertiseOnReddit}.
The site is split into ``subreddits'' wherein users can post entries as plain text, pictures and links to other websites. \nl

Entries are ranked by the users who can either ``upvote'' or ``downvote''. This
is the case for entries and comments. \citep{AboutReddit}\nl

Users can follow other users such that all activity from the followed users is
shown in a designated tab \fix{}{I mean like, yeah you can, but is it that
relevant, not even a source}.

\subsubsection{Reddit API}\label{subsec:reddit-api}
Reddit has a \ac{REST} \ac{API} that provides access to a user's information,
posts and comments in subreddits, as well as moderation tools, that allow for
manipulation of these \citep{RedditApi}. Software that interacts with the
\ac{API} must follow certain rules. These include using OAuth2 to ensure that a
user has given consent and that all requests are seen as coming from that user,
and checking the rate-limiting headers returned with every server response and
making sure to uphold them.
Additionally, every client should provide a specially tailored \ttt{User-Agent}
\ac{HTTP} header field, following the template: \citep{RedditApiRules}\nl

\begin{center}
  \ttt{<platform>:<app ID>:<version string> (by /u/<reddit username>)}
\end{center}\nl
\begin{description}
  \item[\ttt{platform}] a descriptive name for the platform type on which the client is running.
  \item[\ttt{app ID}] a unique name for the client, which could be formed like a Java package namespace.
  \item[\ttt{version string}] identifies the version of the client uniquely
  within the given \ttt{app ID}.
  \item[\ttt{reddit username}] is the username of the creator of a client who
  should be contacted by the Reddit team in case of problems.
\end{description}\nl

Spoofing another client or a browser using the \ttt{User-Agent} \ac{HTTP} header field is strictly prohibited and
results in a ban if discovered. \citep{RedditApiRules}\nl
