\section{Data Gathering Conclusion}\label{sec:social-media-conclusion}
After considering the three sites Facebook, Reddit, Twitter, and a web crawler
and analysing the possibilities they provide. The decision as to which we
should use is based on ease of use, level of access and form of the data.\nl

We have therefore decided to use Twitter, as the short form of tweets are
expected to provide more results of a smaller size resulting in less data to
analyse overall. Twitter is also less locked down with a public default
setting, making it easier to access enough information to identify a \fb. It is
expected that the because the tweets are short then they will be more direct,
because Twitter enforces a strict 140 character limit on each tweet. Therefore,
it is expected that sifting through the data will require less effort.\nl

Crawlers were decided against as there are a lot of restrictions to what it is
allowed to access. We have determined that while it is possible to use a
regular crawler to gather data, it is preferable to use the official Twitter
\ac{API} designed for the purpose. We made this decision, as the
\ac{API} gives access to all relevant data by using a simple set of \ac{HTTP}
requests, while a crawler has to adhere to a stricter set of limitations.
