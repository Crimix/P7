\section{Social Media Conclusion}\label{sec:social-media-conclusion}
After considering the three sites Facebook, Reddit and Twitter, and
analysing the possibilities they provide, it were decided to focus on
Twitter to form an image of a user's \fb.\nl


The decision was based on ease of use, level of access, and the short form of
tweets from Twitter. It is expected to provide more results of a smaller size
resulting in less data to analyse overall. Twitter is also less locked down with
a public default setting, making it easier to access enough information to
identify a \fb. We expect that the since the tweets are short, then they will be
more direct because Twitter enforces a strict 140 character limit on each tweet.
Therefore, it is expected that sifting through the data will require less effort.\nl

The following chapter will investigate how to create and gather data with a web
crawler, and if such program should be used instead, or with the Twitter
\ac{API}.
