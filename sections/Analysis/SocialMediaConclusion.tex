\section{Data Gathering Conclusion}\label{sec:social-media-conclusion}
After considering the three sites Facebook, Reddit and Twitter, and
analysing the possibilities they provide, we have chosen to continue to work
with Twitter. The decision was based on ease of use, level of access, and the
short form of tweets from Twitter. It is expected to provide more results of a
smaller size resulting in less data to analyse overall. Twitter is also less
locked down with a public default setting, making it easier to access enough
information to identify a \fb. It is expected that the because the tweets are
short then they will be more direct, because Twitter enforces a strict 140
character limit on each tweet. Therefore, it is expected that sifting through
the data will require less effort.\nl
