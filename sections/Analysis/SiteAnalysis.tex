A user's web-activity is an unfathomable amount of data, including data on how
many times, how often, the duration and activity on every page a user visit and
their searches. This activity-data gets stored from a user's actions on any
device the user is logged onto, and it requires extensive analysing to get
useful information.

Research shows that given a fairly active user on social media sites, then much
can be learned by sifting the enormous amount of data. With the data, enough
information about a user can be found to provide a qualified guess about the
user's political point of view \citep{Personality}.\nl

Currently, the biggest social media sites with most activity are Facebook and
YouTube \citep{SocialMediaStats}. However, YouTube is based on videos which are
a different medium to manage, therefore YouTube will not be inspected further.
Services with a primary focus on direct messages between users will also be
dismissed. The most suitable opinion-based social media for data gathering, are
sites with many users openly interacting with each other, where opinions and
information gets provided through text.\nl

This chapter will focus on Facebook with 2,047, Twitter with 328 and Reddit with
1285 million users \citep{FacebookPopularity}. It will examine how each of the
site's users interacts, and what the API can do.
