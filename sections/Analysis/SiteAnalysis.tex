\chapter{Data Gathering}\label{cha:DG}
In order to identify a user's filter bubble, we need to analyse that user's
online activity, such that we can determine what people and information they
engage with. A user's online activity consists of large amounts of information,
including data on what websites they frequent, or which people they engage with
on social media. In the case of social media, this activity data get stored on
that site's servers, and in the case of browsing history, the data can be stored
locally on the user's device. While the user's data contain a lot of both useful
and irrelevant information, the vast amount of user data requires extensive
analysis to deduce something about a user.\nl

As we will need a reliable way to gather large amounts of data about a user,
this chapter will be used to analyse different sources of data, and methods of
gathering said data. In \autoref{sec:Social} we present a number of different
social media, and discuss what data we can gather from them, and what tools they
have available for accessing the data. In \autoref{subsec:crawler} we discuss an
alternative approach to gathering data, namely by using a web-crawler.
Finally, we conclude what approach is the most suitable for information
gathering.

\section{Social Media}\label{sec:Social}
In order to find a source of user data, this section will be used to analyze a
number of prominent social media sites. These sites can be seen in
\autoref{tab:priminentMedia} with their number of active
users \citep{SocialMediaStats, AdvertiseOnReddit}.

\begin{table}[H]\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}\hline
\textbf{Social Media} & \textbf{Active Users (Millions)}\\\hline
Facebook & 2061 \\\hline
YouTube & 1500 \\\hline
WhatsApp & 1300 \\\hline
Messenger & 1300 \\\hline
Twitter & 328\\\hline
Reddit &  250\\\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Social media sites and their number of active users}
\label{tab:priminentMedia}
\end{table}

Based on the number of active users, the most prominent social media sites are
Facebook followed by YouTube. However, while YouTube is a large social media
site, it is mainly used to upload and share videos. As this data is difficult to
analyze, we have chosen not to not inspect YouTube any further. In
addition, services focusing on direct messages between users, like Messenger and
WhatsApp are omitted, as this data is not publicly available. As such, the most
suitable social media sites to gather data from, are websites where many users
are openly interacting with each other, and where opinions and information get
exchanged through text posts and comments. Such sites include Facebook,
Twitter, and Reddit.\nl
