The biggest social media sites with most activity, are currently Facebook and
YouTube \citep{SocialMediaStats}.
However, YouTube is largely based on videos which are a less easy media to
manage, therefore YouTube will not be inspected further. Other services which
focus on private direct messages between users will also be dismissed. The most
suitable opinion based social media for data gathering is sites with many users
openly interacting with each other, and opinions and information comes through
text. This report will examine Facebook with 2,047, Twitter with 328 and
Reddit with 1285 million users. To find out which one is the best fit, to inspect and
find if a user is in a bubble on a subject.
