\chapter{Data Gathering}\label{cha:DG}
To identify a user's filter bubble, we need to analyse their
online activity, so we can determine what people and information they
engage with. A user's online activity consists of large amounts of information,
including data on which websites they frequent, or which people they engage with
on social media. While the user's data contains a lot of both
useful and irrelevant information, the vast amount of user data requires extensive
analysis to deduce something about a user.\nl

As we need a reliable way to gather large amounts of data about a user,
this chapter is used to analyse different sources of data and methods of
gathering said data.\nl

In \autoref{sec:Social}, we present a number of different
social media, discuss which data we can gather from them and what tools they
have available for accessing the data. In \autoref{subsec:crawler}, we discuss
an alternative approach to gathering data, namely by using a web-crawler.
Finally, we conclude which approach is the most suitable for information
gathering.

\section{Social Media}\label{sec:Social}
This section is used to analyse a number of prominent social media sites. These
sites can be seen in \autoref{tab:priminentMedia} with their number of active
users \citep{SocialMediaStats, AdvertiseOnReddit}.

\begin{table}[H]\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}\hline
\textbf{Social Media} & \textbf{Active Users (Millions)}\\\hline
Facebook & 2061 \\\hline
YouTube & 1500 \\\hline
WhatsApp & 1300 \\\hline
Messenger & 1300 \\\hline
Twitter & 328\\\hline
Reddit &  250\\\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Social media sites and their number of active users.}
\label{tab:priminentMedia}
\end{table}

Based on the number of active users, the most prominent social media sites are
Facebook followed by YouTube. However, while YouTube is a large social media
site, it is mainly used to upload and share videos. As this data is difficult to
analyse, we have chosen not to inspect YouTube any further. In addition,
services focusing on direct messages between users, like Messenger and WhatsApp
are omitted, as this data is not publicly available. The most suitable social
media sites to gather data from, are websites where many users are openly
interacting with each other and where opinions and information are exchanged
through text posts and comments. Such sites include Facebook, Twitter and
Reddit.\nl
