%Klaus: it would be nice to provide an overview to this chapter either here or
% on analisis part (Har smidt den efter initerende problem)

\fix{}{Might need a slight change to start of chapter}
To identify a user's filter bubble, we need to analyse their online activity, in
order to determine what people and informational sources they engage with. This
web-activity consists of a large amount of information, including data on how
many times and how often, a user visits a page, and which people they follow or
in other ways engage with on social media. This activity data get stored on the
pages the user frequents, in the case of social sites, or locally on the device
the user is logged onto in the form of search and browsing history. While this
data contains a lot of information, the raw nature of it makes it require
extensive analysing to get useful information.\nl

\fix{}{Change the what happens in this chpater}

This chapter will focus on Facebook with 2061 million, Twitter with 328 million
and Reddit with 1575 million active users \citep{SocialMediaStats, RedditStats}.
It will examine how each of the site's users interacts, and what options they
provide regarding data-gathering on their site. In the end, a conclusion on the
chosen media sites will be derived from the inspected sources.

\section{Social Media}
Currently, the biggest social media sites with most activity are Facebook and
YouTube \citep{SocialMediaStats}. However, YouTube is based on videos which are
a different medium to manage, therefore YouTube will not be inspected further.
Services with a primary focus on direct messages between users will also be
dismissed. The most suitable opinion-based social media for data gathering, are
sites with many users openly interacting with each other, where opinions and
information gets provided through text.\nl

If given fairly active users on social media sites, then much can be learned by
sifting the enormous amount of data. By analyzing hashtags and combine
”\#ImWithHer” or ”\#TrumpTrain” with ”\#election2016” which gives an idea about
a users political view. With enough user data being analysed much about a user
can be found, perhaps enough to provide a qualified guess about a user's
political point of view.\nl
