The biggest social media sites with most activity, are currently Facebook and
YouTube \citep{SocialMediaStats}.
However, YouTube is largely based on videos which are a less easy media to
manage, therefore YouTube will not be inspected further. Other services which
focus on private direct messages between users will also be dismissed. The most
suitable opinion based social media for data gathering is sites with many users
openly interacting with each other, and opinions and information comes through
text.\nl

This chapter will focus on Facebook with 2,047, Twitter with 328 and
Reddit with 1285 million users. It will describe how the each of the sites
users interact as well what the API can do. Finally we will conclude on which
social media we will use.
