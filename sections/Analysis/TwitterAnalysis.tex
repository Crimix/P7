\section{Twitter Analysis}\label{sec:twitter-analysis}
Twitter is a global social media site with more than 328 million active users
\citep{aboutTwitter}. Twitter's users can generally be split into two groups,
private citizens and businesses. While businesses might use Twitter for
announcements and marketing, private citizens are more likely to use Twitter for
general communication and to discuss global and local events. In general,
Twitter defines itself as being used for the following purposes
\citep{StartingTwitter}:

\begin{enumerate}    
  \item News and Politics.
  \item Sports.
  \item Pop Culture. 
  \item Influencers.
  \item Utility.
\end{enumerate}

As this project attempts to widen a given user's online information feed, we
are going to focus on the first topic, namely ``News and Politics''.

\subsection{Using Twitter}
A Twitter user can make use of the following elements \citep{StartingTwitter}
in order to make tweets and communicate with other users:

\subsubsection{Tweet}
A tweet is a message, which a user can post from their account. A tweet can
contain 140 characters\citep{StartingTwitter2} of text, links, pictures and
similar media sources, and be seen by all other users. Users who ``follow'' the
account will automatically be presented with the tweet on their Twitter profile.

\subsubsection{Follow}
A user can choose to follow other peoples accounts. This allows them to be
notified whenever that account makes a tweet or retweets an existing tweet.

\subsubsection{Retweet}
Instead of making a tweet, a user can choose to forward a tweet made by another
account. A user can either retweet the tweet as it is, or embed the tweet into a
tweet of their own. The user can make comments or remarks in relation to the
original tweet.

\subsubsection{Hashtag}
When a user tweets or retweets, they can add a ``hashtag'', which can be used to
group the tweet, with others using the same hashtag. A hashtag is used as a
general tag, such as \#Politics or \#Sports, or in order to specify the user's
opinion on a subject e.g. \#war \#Idiotic. In general, hashtags are used for
searching and filtering.

\subsection{Twitter \acp{API}}
For developers to retrieve data from users, tweets and trending hashtags,
Twitter has three main \acp{API}, namely the \ac{REST} \ac{API}, the Streaming
\ac{API} and the Ads \ac{API} \citep{TwitterDevDocs}. For the purpose of this
project, we use the \ac{REST} \ac{API}, as it allows us to read historical twitter
data.

\subsubsection{REST API}
The \ac{REST} \ac{API} makes use of \ac{HTTP} requests to allow developers access to
Twitter's data \citep{TwitterREST}. In addition, by using the OAuth protocol
\citep{TwitterOAuth}, Twitter ensures that only authorized applications can
access Twitter's data.\nl

Twitter makes use of a \ac{REST} \ac{API}. All requests must be made using the
\ac{HTTP} protocol. These requests are structured differently based on the
requested data. An example of a \ac{HTTP} request can be seen in
\autoref{httpReq}, where each of the requests parts have been denoted with a
number, and is further described in \autoref{httpElaboration}.
