\chapter{GUI} \label{GUI}
As described in \autoref{ch:intro}, the target audience of our application is
Americans who are politically active on Twitter. As such, the goal is to create
a GUI that reflects the expectations of this group of users. Politics is a serious
topic, so we aim to create a simplistic and formal interface that does not
include unnecessary distractions.

\section{Front page}
The front page features the logo with the search bar below. Underneath the
search bar is the search button and a information button. A visual presentation
of the front page can be seen on \autoref{GUIfrontPage}.

\figxb[0.6]{GUIfrontPage}{The front page of the application.}

The color scheme on the front page is a white background with a dark gray text.
The white background promotes a feeling of cleanliness and simplicity, while the
gray text promotes neutrality and formality \citep[p. 63 \& 64]{WebUI}. 
The ``Check user'' button is a middle ground between light and dark blue, which
results in a promotion of calm, safety and reliability \citep[p. 61]{WebUI}.

\section{Authorization popup}

When searching for a user, a popup requiring a login pops up. The reason why
logging in is required is due to the fact that a limited amount of requests to
Twitter is allowed. By logging in as another user, we use their requests rather
than our own. A visual representation of the popup can be seen on
\autoref{GUIauthPopup}.

\figx[0.6]{GUIauthPopup}{The authorization popup.}

The Popup window has, like the front page, a blue button and a gray font on a
white background for the same reasons and to keep true to the theme.
Furthermore, there is a green button to aquire the authorization PIN from
Twitter. This button is green so that it is in contrast to everything else one
the screen. Green is a gap between calming colors like the ones used by our
application and energizing colors like orange and yellow, so it catches the
user's eye \citep[p. 60]{WebUI}. Additional pictures of the pages met during the
authorization PIN retrievement can be seen on \fix{}{Make appendix with all the
unused GUI pics}.

\section{The E-mail}
After pressing the blue ``Verify" button, the application starts processing.
When the application is done processing the request, an E-mail is sent to the provided E-mail address. This E-mail consists of a short text telling the user
that the results are in for the requested Twitter account and provides a link to
the results.
A visual presentation of the E-mail can be seen on \autoref{GUImail}.

\figx[0.7]{GUImail}{The email received after the application is done
processing.}

The E-mail is Gray with a white box with the information and the blue button.
This is done to stay true to the color scheme. 

\section{The result screen}
After clicking on the blue button in the E-mail, a web page with the results
opens. On this page, a header shows some information about the retrievement
process itself, shown on \fix{}{insert ref to the appendix made above}. Beneath
the header is a bunch of graphs depicting different aspects of the analysis.
Each graph has a long and detailed description of what is on the graph and how
it was calculated. The graph on \autoref{GUIresult1} depicts political bias and
the average sentiment of everyone in the filter bubble and the user itself. 

\figx[0.5]{GUIresult1}{Graph showing the relation between bias}

Apart from this, there are two bar charts showing the bias of the
filter bubble according to the Naive Bayes algorithm and the Bag of words
algorithm respectively. The bar chart for the bag of words algorithm can be seen
on \autoref{GUIresult2}. The one for Naive Bayes can be seen in \fix{}{same as
above} together with the charts for sentiment analysis and media bias described
below which are both calculated by the Bag of Words algorithm.

\figx[0.5]{GUIresult2}{The bar chart depicting bias according to the Bag
of Words algorithm.}

The design of the result screen follows the gray theme. The bars are colorcoded,
such that the bars around the middle are gray and transparent, whereas the
farther the bars are from the middle, the more red/blue and opaque they become.
This is done to visually represent which side the users are placed, since the
left side is associated with blue, whereas the right side is associated with red
in American politics. There is an exception with the bar where the checked user
is located which is colored yellow. On the graph depicting bias and sentiment as
a scatter plot, all dots to the right are red, all dots between -1 and 1 bias are
gray and all dots to the left are blue. The dot representing the checked user is
green.

\section{Overall design choice}
The reason for the overall design choice is the power of simplicity. By having a
simplistic design with a lot of whitespace, all focus goes to what is
important; The text boxes and buttons. There are no distracting
pictures or unnecessary information.\citep[p. 26 \& 32]{WebUI}.\\
