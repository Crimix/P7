\chapter{GUI} \label{GUI}
As described in \autoref{ch:intro}, the target audience of our application is
americans who are politically active on Twitter. As such, the goal is to create
a GUI that reflects the expectations of this group of users. Politics is a serious
topic, so we aim to create a simplistic and formal interface that does not
include unnecessary distractions.

\section{Front page}
The front page features the logo with the functionality below. For this
project, only searching for Twitter users and getting their filter bubble is
possible. More functionality can be added for future work. A visual
presentation of the front page can be seen on \autoref{frontPage}.

\figx[0.6]{frontPage}{The front page of the application.}

The colorscheme on the front page is a white background with a dark gray text.
The white background promotes a feeling of cleanliness and simplicity, while the
gray text promotes neutrality and formality \citep[p. 63 \& 64]{WebUI}. 

\section{Request page}
After clicking on the ``CHECK TWITTER USER'' button, it opens the interface for
the request page. It features an input text box for the Twitter username and a
search button. A visual presentation of the request page can be seen on \autoref{twitterRequest}.

\figx[0.6]{twitterRequest}{The ``Check twitter user'' page.}

The request page uses a gray background for the neutrality and formality that we
want to promote due to the fact that the whole purpose of the project is to
make Twitter users have a more politically neutral in their Twitter feed.
The button is a middle ground between light and dark blue, which results in
a promotion of calm, safety and reliability \citep[p. 61 \& 64]{WebUI}.

\section{Authorization popup}

When searching for a user, a popup requiring a login pops up. The reason why
logging in is required is due to the fact that a limited amount of requests to
Twitter is allowed. By logging in as another user, we use their requests rather
than our own. A visual representation of the popup can be seen on
\autoref{twitterAuth}.

\figx[0.6]{twitterAuth}{The authorization popup.}

The Popup window has a simple black text on a white background. The background
is white rather than gray, such that it stands out from the request page. The
button is still blue, such that it provides the user a feeling of calm, safety
and reliability, which is the perfect feeling to provide when asking them to
trust us with their authorization \citep[p. 61]{WebUI}.

\section{The E-mail}
When the application is done processing the request, an E-mail is sent to the
provided E-mail address. This E-mail consists of a short text telling the user
that the results are in and a link to the results. A visual presentation of the
E-mail can be seen on \autoref{mail}.

\figx[0.6]{mail}{The email received after the application is done processing.}

The E-mail is Gray with a white box with the information and the blue button.
This is done to stay true to the color scheme. 

\section{The result screen}
After clicking on the blue button in the E-mail, a web page with the results
opens. On this page, the name of the checked user and a bunch of graphs with
different information can be found.
The graph on \autoref{result1} depicts political
bias and the average sentiment of everyone in the filter bubble and the user
itself. 

\figx[0.4]{result1}{Graph showing the relation between media bias}

Apart from this, there are several bar charts showing the media bias of the
filterbubble according to the Naive Bayes algorithm and the Bag of words
algorithm respectively. An example of this can be seen on \autoref{result2}. 

\figx[0.4]{result2}{The bar chart depicting media bias according to the Bag of
Words algorithm.}

Lastly, there are bar charts showing the sentiment analysis and media bias,
which both are by the Bag of Words algorithm. \\

The design of the result screen follows the gray theme. The bars are colorcoded,
such that the bars around the middle are gray and transparent, whereas the
farther the bars are from the middle, the more red/blue and opaque they become.
This is done to visually represent which side the users are placed, since the
left side is associated with blue, whereas the right side is associated with red
in American politics. There is exception being the bar where the checked user is
located which is colored green. On the graph depicting bias and sentiment as a
scatter plot, all dots to the right are red, all dots between -1 and 1 bias are
gray and all dots to the left are blue. The dot representing the checked user is
green.

\section{Overall design choice}
The reason for the overall design choice is the power of simplicity. By having a
simplistic design with a lot of whitespace, all focus goes to what is
important; The text boxes and buttons. There are no distracting
pictures or unnecessary information.\citep[p. 26 \& 32]{WebUI}.\\
