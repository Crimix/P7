\chapter{Classification}\label{cha:classification}
To classify the political leanings of a Twitter user, we have developed
two different models which we described in \autoref{subsub:Models}. Both of
these models take a list of tweets as an input and outputs a decimal value
between -10 and 10. This value indicates what we determine to be the user's
political leaning, where a lower value indicates a left-wing and a higher value
indicates right-wing. This modelling was chosen, as it allows for easy, visual
representation and has a clear centre of 0 which indicates neutrality.
Additionally, as both models give a positive or negative value to
tweets, it allows for easy summation when representing the final result.\nl

In \autoref{sec:BoW}, we implement a modified version of the Bag-of-Words
classifier. In \autoref{sec:NBImp}, we implement a simple Naive Bayes
classifier.\nl
