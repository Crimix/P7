\chapter{Classification}

In order to classify the political leanings of a twitter user, we have
developed two different solutions, which we described in
\autoref{subsub:Models}. In \autoref{sec:BoW} we implement a modified version of
the Bag-Of-Words classifier. In \autoref{sec:NBImp} we implement a simple Naive
Bayes classifier.
