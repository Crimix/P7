\chapter{Classification}\label{cha:classification}
To classify the political leanings of a twitter user, we have developed
two different solutions, which we described in \autoref{subsub:Models}. In
\autoref{sec:BoW} we implement a modified version of the Bag-Of-Words
classifier. In \autoref{sec:NBImp} we implement a simple Naive Bayes
classifier.\nl

Both of these models take as an input a list of Tweets relating to a single
user, and outputs a decimal value between -10 and 10. This value indicates
what we determine to be the user's political leaning, where a lower value
indicates a left-wing and a higher value indicates right-wing. This modelling
was chosen, as it allows for easy visual representation, and has clear
middle-point of 0, which indicates neutrality. Additionally, as both
models gives a variable positive or negative value to tweets, it allows for easy
summation when representing the final result.
