\chapter{Database \ac{API}}\label{DatabaseAPI} \fix{}{Det her skal lige
omskrives når database apien er helt færdig} 
As a part of the overall
application, we need a database to store information used by the different workers. This is important, as we make use of the
user's Twitter account to retrieve data from the Twitter \ac{API}. As such, this
section is used to describe how we access and store this data, and how we
make sure that it is only accessible to authorized users.

\section{Database Design}\label{DBDesign}
We have opted to use MySQL as our \ac{DBS}, structuring our data in a
standardized relational database. In order to store the general data, we have
two tables; \textc{Users} and \textc{Twitters}, as seen in
\autoref{TwitterDBTable} and \autoref{UserDBTable}. \fix{}{Tables skal lige
opdateres til hvad de er nu}

\begin{table}[H]
\begin{tabular}{l | l | l | l | l | l | l | l	}
\textbf{id} & \textbf{name} & \textbf{twitterID} & \textbf{pol\_var} &
\textbf{lib\_var} & \textbf{protect} & \textbf{created\_at} & \textbf{updated\_at}
\\\hline 1 & John123 & 4893758 & 4.1 & 3.5 & 1 & 03-11-2017 & 03-11-2017 
\\\hline 2 & MMan & 9302847 & 2.9 & 1.7 & 0 & 03-11-2017 & 03-11-2017 
\\\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Table containing twitter users and their determined values.}
\label{TwitterDBTable}
\end{table}

\textc{Twitters} is used for storing data about analyzed
twitter users, such that we can reference this data if we should receive
a request. This allows to reduce overhead, as we can reuse data. One important
aspect is that we need to respect a user's privacy. As such, we have introduced
the ``protect'' boolean to indicate if only the Twitter user, which the result
belong to, is allowed to retrieve it.

\begin{table}[H]
\begin{tabular}{l | l | l | l | l }
\textbf{id} & \textbf{name} & \textbf{password} &
\textbf{created\_at} & \textbf{updated\_at}\\\hline
1 & Worker\_1 & xyaAngeaG93AFk & 03-11-2017 & 03-11-2017
\\\hline
2 & Worker\_2 & oLj7Ft89AFSA & 03-11-2017 & 03-11-2017 \\\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Table containing twitter users and their determined values.}
\label{UserDBTable}
\end{table}

\textc{Users} is used for authenticating workers. This means that each time a
user uses our application, that instance is saved as a worker. This worker has
an automatically generated name and password.

\section{\ac{API} Design}
In order to access the database described in \autoref{DBDesign}, we have
developed an \ac{API} using the Laravel web development framework. This \ac{API} functions
as a layer on top of the database, to which we can make requests and retrieve
data through the use of \ac{HTTP} requests.

\subsection{\ac{API} Endpoints}
As the \ac{API} uses \ac{HTTP} requests, we have to define a number of
endpoints which are available to be used by external applications. These are based on the following
request:\nl

\say{http://localhost:8000/api/}\nl

In this example, the domain for the \ac{API} is localhost on port 8000, as this is
the default for locally hosted Laravel applications. In order to access the
data, we have the following endpoints:

\begin{table}[H]
\begin{tabular}{l | l | l}
\textbf{TYPE} & \textbf{Endpoint} & \textbf{Required Data} \\\hline
POST & api/twitter   & 	\textc{string} name\\
~    & ~			 &  \textc{int} twitterID\\
~    & ~			 &  \textc{double} pol\_var\\
~    & ~			 &  \textc{double} lib\_var\\
~    & ~			 &  \textc{boolean} protect				      
\\\hline
POST & api/user      & \textc{string} name\\
~    & ~			 &  \textc{string(Encrypted)} password					      
\\\hline
POST & oauth/token 	& \textc{grant\_type} password					  \\
~    & ~			& \textc{client\_id} 2					\\
~    & ~			& \textc{client\_secret} XIpLV3Jl\ldots					\\
~    & ~			& \textc{username} Worker					\\
~    & ~			& \textc{password(Encrypted)} ERExjM0rVvcC7zfJvSbU					\\
~    & ~			& \textc{scope} *					     
\\\hline
GET & api/user/\{id\} &
\\\hline
GET & api/twitter/\{twitterID\} &
\\\hline


\end{tabular}
\caption{Table containing twitter users and their determined values. Note that
the variables in the token request are example values}
\label{APIEndpointTable}
\end{table}
 

\subsection{Authorization}
In order to make sure that data is only available to authorized users, we make
use of Laravel Passports, which is a token-based authorization system. As such,
in order to make a request to the database, the user has to supply a token,
which is an encrypted string. This token is then verified by comparing it to a
list of active tokens on the database.\nl

In order to retrieve a token, a worker must make a request to the
``oauth/token'' endpoint, while supplying a username, password, and client
secret. The username and password are compared to those stored in the user's
table on the database, and the client\_secret is a static string.\nl

If the supplied credentials are found on the database, the request responds with
a token, which uniquely identifies the worker which made the request. When
making requests for data on the database, the worker must supply this token,
which is used to authenticate it.\nl
