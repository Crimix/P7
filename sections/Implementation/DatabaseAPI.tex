\chapter{Database API}
As a part of the overall application, we need a database to store information
used by the different workers. This is important, as we make use of the
user's Twitter account to retreive data from the Twitter API. As such, this
section will be used to describe how we access and store this data, and how we
make sure that it is only accessible to authorized users.

\section{Database Design}\label{DBDesign}
The database uses the MySQL framework, and is built as a standardized relational
database. In order to store the general data, we have two tables; \textc{Users}
and \textc{Twitters}. These tables can be seen in \autoref{TwitterDBTable}
and \autoref{UserDBTable}.

\begin{table}[H]
\begin{tabular}{l | l | l | l | l | l | l}
\textbf{id} & \textbf{name} & \textbf{twitterID} & \textbf{pol\_var} & \textbf{lib\_var} & \textbf{created\_at} & \textbf{updated\_at}\\\hline
1 & John123 & 4893758 & 4.1 & 3.5 & 03-11-2017 & 03-11-2017 \\\hline
2 & MMan & 9302847 & 2.9 & 1.7 & 03-11-2017 & 03-11-2017 \\\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Table containing twitter users and their determined values.}
\label{TwitterDBTable}
\end{table}

The table in \autoref{TwitterDBTable} is used for storing data about analyzed
twitter users, such that we can reference this data, if we should recieve
a request for that user to be analyzed again. This allows to to reduce overhead,
as we can reuse data.

\begin{table}[H]
\begin{tabular}{l | l | l | l | l | l}
\textbf{id} & \textbf{name} & \textbf{password} & \textbf{authString} &
\textbf{created\_at} & \textbf{updated\_at}\\\hline
1 & Worker\_1 & xyaAngeaG93AFk & A83hjgGAD8u4h & 03-11-2017 & 03-11-2017
\\\hline
2 & Worker\_2 & oLj7Ft89AFSA & fawef78GADKe & 03-11-2017 & 03-11-2017 \\\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Table containing twitter users and their determined values.}
\label{UserDBTable}
\end{table}

The table in \autoref{TwitterDBTable} is used for authenticating workers. This
means, that each time a users uses our application, that instance will be saved
as a worker. This worker has an automatically generated name and password, and
an authentication string, which is used for accessing Twitter's API.


\section{API Design}
In order to access the database described in \autoref{DBDesign}, we have
deveoped an API using the Laravel web development framework. This API functions
as a layer on top of the database, to which we can make requests and retreive
data through the use of HTTP requests.

\subsection{API Endpoints}
As the API uses HTTP requests, we have to define a number of endpoints which are
available to be used by external applications. These are based on the following
request:\nl

\say{http://localhost:8000/api/}\nl

In this example, the domain for the API is localhost on port 8000, as this is
the default for locally hosted Laravel applications. In order to access the
data, we have the following endpoints:

\begin{table}[H]
\begin{tabular}{l | l | l}
\textbf{TYPE} & \textbf{Endpoint} & \textbf{Required Data} \\\hline
POST & api/user/post & 	\textc{string} name\\
~    & ~			 &  \textc{int} twitterID					      \\
~    & ~			 &  \textc{double} pol\_var					      \\
~    & ~			 &  \textc{doble} lib\_var					      
\\\hline
POST & api/twitter/post & \textc{string} name					  \\
~    & ~			 &  \textc{string(Encrypted)} password					      
\\\hline
POST & oauth/token 	& \textc{grant\_type} password					  \\
~    & ~			& \textc{client\_id} 2					\\
~    & ~			& \textc{client\_secret} XIpLV3Jl\ldots					\\
~    & ~			& \textc{username} Worker					\\
~    & ~			& \textc{password(Encrypted)} ERExjM0rVvcC7zfJvSbU					\\
~    & ~			& \textc{scope} *					     
\\\hline
GET & api/user/get/\{id\} & \\\hline
GET & api/twitter/get/\{twitterID\} & \\\hline


\end{tabular}
\caption{Table containing twitter users and their determined values. Note that
the variables in the token request are example values}
\label{APIEndpointTable}
\end{table}
 

\subsection{Authorization}
In order to make sure that data is only available to authorized users, we make
use of Laravel Passports, which is a token-based authorization system. As such,
in order to make a request to the database, the user has to supply a token,
which is an encrypted string. This token is then verified by comparing it to a
list of active tokens on the database.\nl

In order to retrieve a token, a worker must make a request to the
``oauth/token'' endpoint, while supplying a username, password, and client
secret. The username and password are compared to those stored in the users
table on the database, and the client\_secret is a static string.\nl

If the supplied credentials are found on the database, the request responds with
a token, which uniquely identifies the worker which made the request. When
making requests for data on the database, the worker must supply this token,
which is used to authenticate it.\nl

\fix{}{This chapter was written while I was half blind, and very annoyed with my
contact lenses. As such, it needs some more info in some parts (more tables,
better description of requests and responses). Also proof read (half-blind,
remember?). Also, add references to tables.}
