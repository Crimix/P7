\chapter{Problem Statement}\label{ch:problem}
% Our project for this semester is to break filter bubbles. Therefore, we
% first approached it by trying to figure out which social media would be most
% suitable and analyzed how to collect a vast amount of user data, from the sites
% to identify a filter bubble.
% This chapter will summarize the conclusions, and define a problem
% statement.\nl
%----------------

As stated in \autoref{sec:initproblem}, the goal of this project is
to aid politically active, American users in identifying and breaking their
filter bubbles on social media. Based on this problem, \autoref{cha:DG} and
\autoref{cha:DA} were used to identify ways of gathering and analysing data
that could be used to determine a user's filter bubble.\nl

In \autoref{sec:social-media-conclusion}, we concluded that Twitter is most
suitable for gathering data, as Twitter provides an \ac{API} that permits us
to easily request all relevant data from a user. The data consists of tweets,
followers and friends of any such user.\nl

In \autoref{sec:DAConc}, we concluded that sentiment analysis can be used to
determine the filter bubbles for predefined domains. We also found two different
models that are capable of performing sentiment analysis and a way to use news
media to determine political leanings.\nl

Based on the subject of this semester described in \autoref{sec:initproblem},
namely creating a web-application, we have chosen to develop a system with a
web-page front-end and a server-side back-end to handle the processing of
information. Based on these conclusions, we establish the following problem
statement:\nl

identifying and breaking out of a filter bubble on Twitter? How can the
analysis of sentiments be used to determine a users political leaning?}
