\section{Related Work} There have been a number of papers written on
the subject of sentiment analysis using social media.
\cited{pennacchiotti2011machine} employs machine learning to analyse a
user's feed on the social media site Twitter. They specifically aimed to
classify a user's political orientation or nationality by using observable
information such as user behaviour, network structure and the linguistic content
of their communications. Another approach comes from \cited{sarlan2014twitter} who
attempts to use a Bag-of-Words model for sentiment analysis, where a lexicon of
sentimental words are used to identify a general sentiment.
This approach aims to enable companies to assess what users think of their
products. This works by splitting their posts on social media into positive and
negative categories based on their use of emotional keywords. A different
approach is also utilised by \cited{go2009twitter}, who aim to determine a
user's sentiment by using a Naive Bayes classifier trained using positive and
negative social media posts.
