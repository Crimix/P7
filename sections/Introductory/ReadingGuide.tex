\section{Reading Guide}\label{sec:readingGuide}
This section provides an overview of which order the different parts of the
report should be read and provides a list of the various terms used throughout
the report.

\subsection{Chapter Guide}
\autoref{ch:intro} starts by briefly describing the filter bubble and
the associated problems. It ends by introducing a set of initial problems for
further analysis.\nl

\autoref{cha:DG} starts by discussing various sources of relevant user
data, and how this data can be gathered and accessed. It ends by concluding that
Twitter is best suited for our needs, and that we will use it as a data
source.\nl

\autoref{cha:DA} starts by discussing how user data, in the form of tweets, can
be analyzed in order to determine a users filter bubble. In ends by concluding
that we want to make two models, one using a Bag-of-Words approach, and another
using a Naive Bayes Network.\nl

\autoref{ch:problem} follows on from the analysis of the problem area, and
states our intent to break the filter bubble by determining the political bias
of the accounts a user follows on Twitter.\nl

\autoref{cha:req} presents a number of functional- and usability requirements,
which are deemed necessary to fulfill in order to successfully develop the
software solution.\nl

\autoref{ch:sysview} presents an overview of all parts of the developed system,
and describes how they interact with eachother. The system consists of a
web-application front-end, a database, and a backend server.\nl

\autoref{DatabaseAPI} describes the development of the API which is used to
interacting with the database. This API is developed using the Laravel web
application framework.\nl

\autoref{queueAPI} describes the development of the API which is used to
interacting with the backend server. This API is developed using the Microsoft
.NET framework in the language C\#.\nl

\autoref{workerLabel} describes the development of the Worker, which is the part
of the backend server responsible for determining a users filter bubble. This is
done using both the Bag-of-Words model, and the Naive Bayes Network.\nl

\autoref{Classification} describes the development of the two different
classification algorithms. Namely the Bag-of-Words model, and the Naive Bayes
Network.\nl 

\autoref{cha:twitterAPI} describes how we interact with the Twitter API in order
to gather the required data for analysis.\nl

\autoref{GUI} presents the graphical user interface (GUI) of the web-application
front end. It also describes the design choices involved in developing the
visual presentation.\nl

\autoref{cha:testing} presents a number of tests which aim to ensure the quality
of the developed software solution. In ends by concluding the possible
bottlenecks in the execution process, namely the limited amounts of Tweets
retrievalble per second.\nl

\autoref{fwork} discusses what elements of the system could be subject for
future developement.\nl

\autoref{cha:disc} discusses the development process, and other topics which
requires reflection.\nl

\autoref{cha:conclusion} ends the report by concluding on the projects succes in
relation to the system requirements determined in \autoref{cha:req}.
