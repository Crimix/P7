% Needs to be less fluffy.
The internet is widely used to find and gather information about any topics, it
provides a vast amount of information from many different sources, and it is
only growing larger. While easy access to information is a definite benefit, the
enormous amount of information results in each user acquiring a small subset of
the available knowledge.\\
The limits of each user's ability to obtain information put a focus on the
sources they engage with, and especially how those sources pick and choose what
information to present. As of August 2017, upwards of 67\% of adults in the
United States report that they use social media as a source of information
\citep{journalism2017}.
Theoretically, this would not be a problem, as users could use the dynamics
reach of social media to engage with information and news from different
sources. But in reality, users tend to surround themselves with like-minded
people, who in turn are prone to share information that correlates with their
own opinions and biases.\\

This phenomenon is known as the ``Filter Bubble", which is a term coined by Eli
Pariser in his 2007 book ``The Filter Bubble" \citep{pariser2011filter}.
This Bubble refers to the effect of either selectively choosing information
sources based on personal bias or actual algorithms encoded in the social media
sites or search engines.
The aim of which is to present the user with the information which is most
likely to be regarded positively.
The existence and enforcement of this bubble can cause problems, in which users
avoid getting their opinions challenged by preventing them from being exposed to
information and views that are opposed to the bubble in which they find
themselves \citep[p.59-73]{pariser2011filter}\fix{}{So many pages?}.\nl

While this problem is most notable on social media sites, where users actively
surround themselves with like-minded people. Some websites selectively choose
what information to present, this even applies to search engines like Google
\citep{filterBubbleDef} \citep{Personality} In an interview with Eli Pariser, a
search on ``Egypt'' shows a case of Google filtering information based on the
user's preferences. In this example, two users would make a Google search with
the term ``Egypt'', and end up with two widely different set of results.
One user got results with information about ongoing conflicts and news; the
other user saw travel guides and hotel booking information \citep{nusSduSearch}.
