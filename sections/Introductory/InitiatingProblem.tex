\subsection*{Initiating Problem}


Based on this, we can formulate the following initiating problem:


\begin{center}
\begin{minipage}{0.8\linewidth}

\textit{How can a filter bubble be identified by using social media and a web
agent?}

%\textit{How can an interner user search for a topic and find information from
%outside their filter bubble and how are social media sites used to create a
%filter bubble?
%How can a web agent be developed to identify the user's
%filter bubble from web activity and provide results from outside that bubble?}

\end{minipage}
\end{center}
