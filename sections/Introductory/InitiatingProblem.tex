\section*{Initiating Problem} 
The existence of filter bubbles leads to a situation were users actively or
unknowingly limit their exposure to news, opinions, and ideas. Additionally,
filter bubbles based on political views and ideals are known to have opposing
angels. As such, the analysis will focus on identifying and breaking a users
political filter bubble. Based on this problem, the topic of this project,
namely development of web applications, services, and agents: we formulate the
following initiating problem.


\begin{center}
\begin{minipage}{0.95\linewidth}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbk{How can a filter bubble be identified by using social media and
  a web service or agent?}
  
  \item \textbk{What information is available to be gathered from social media
  sites?}
  
  \item \textbk{Which technology, method, or approach is suited to gather
  relevant information from social media sites?}
  
  \item \textbk{How can a user's be analyzed and used to break the user's filter
  bubble?}
  
%   \item \textbk{How can a web agent be developed to identify the user's filter
%   bubble from web activity, and how can it be designed to provide results from
%   outside that bubble?}
\end{enumerate}
\end{minipage}
\end{center}

These problems will be used to guide the analysis in the following chapters.
